# Getting started

To deploy this project to Fly.io, you'll need to deploy 2 apps. One being
Grafana and the other being the Elixir app. Start off by deploying the 
Grafana instance first. Follow the `README.md` instructions in the `grafana` 
directory and then switch over to the `README.md` instructions in the
`todo_list` directory.
