# Monitoring Your Fly.io Apps With Prometheus

This is the companion project and examples for the blog post [Monitoring Your Fly.io Apps With Prometheus](https://fly.io/blog/monitoring-your-fly-io-apps-with-prometheus/).
Go there first for an overview and explanation.

## Getting started

To deploy this project to Fly.io, you'll need to deploy 2 apps. One being
Grafana and the other being the Elixir app. Start off by deploying the
Grafana instance first. Follow the `README.md` instructions in the `grafana`
directory and then switch over to the `README.md` instructions in the
`todo_list` directory.
